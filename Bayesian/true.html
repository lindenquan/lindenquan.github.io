            <h2><strong>Bayesian network</strong></h2>
            <p>A Bayesian network, also called Bayes network, belief network, Bayes(ian) model or probabilistic directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model (a type of statistical model) that represents a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG).[From Wikipedia]</p>
            <h2><strong>Bayesian inference</strong></h2>
            <p>
                Bayesian inference is an approach to answer probability queries about the underlying probability distribution.
            </p>
            <h2><strong>Junction tree algorithm</strong></h2>
            <p>
                The junction tree algorithm (also known as 'Clique Tree' or 'Join Tree') is a method to extract marginalization. In essence, it entails performing belief propagation on a modified graph called a junction tree.[From Wikipedia]

            <h1>The purpose of this site</h1>
            <p>This site is supposed to help you understand the junction tree algorithms in terms of Hugin algorithm and Shafer-Shenoy algorithm.</p>
            <p>This site is for tutorial purpose, not for the real-world application.</p>
            <p>
                In step 1, you need to draw a DAG and enter the corresponding CPTs.
            </p>
            <p>
                In step 2, you need to enter a query.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the following steps, you will learn how the inference algorithem is performed.

            <h1>Draw a DAG and enter CPTs</h1>
            <p>For the sake of simplicity, the name of a variable must be a single letter in lowercase, which means there are 26 variables at most. All of the variables are binary-valued, and all value is in uppercase.<br>For example: a = {A, -A}, t = {T, -T}.</p>
            <p>
            	Please, draw your DAG in the right page, then CTPs will appear in the area below.
